I started a portfolio website project to start on. This website is all about
traveling to sacred ancient places in the world.

Bootstrap I used:

Navbar
Form (booking form)
Table for destination, prices etc.

The 3 Bootstrap Componets

Card is used in the About section also linking to Stones Destination section.
Carousel used on the Home page to give a visual of some of the destinations of travel.
Modal I used on the form to let the user if they are ready for verification.

Javascript

Then fuction for valation for first and last name and function for click me on home page.
